 kid making history right knicks coach david fizdale said robinson win putting groups historic names every single day continues grow get better
 knicks winning streak ended thursday disappointing loss cleveland cavaliers even defeat robinson managed add highlight reel time shot opponent take
 early second quarter cavaliers guard matthew dellavedova got ball clean look basket range prepared shoot noticed robinson feet front rookie lowering shoulder slightly prepared leap dellavedova immediately thought better trying luck passed ball instead seconds later possession robinson got block anyway swatting away layup attempt marquese chriss
 rare player result complicated withdrawal western kentucky university robinson limited minutes game works refine game still third blocks game rated block percentage estimates percentage opponents shots player blocks time floor robinson nothing short stunning percent
 basketball reference tracked block percentage back season seasons among players blocks belong manute bol savant list belongs robinson
 sample size obviously needs considered robinson stands chance qualified player beyond bol alonzo mourning finish season block percentage higher rim protection luminaries serge ibaka mark eaton dikembe mutombo fell short mark best seasons
 robinson quickly become fan favorite believes getting started asked recently many shots could block game team let play minutes night probably around six said feel like get like six
 season record blocks per game set eaton yet robinson boast seem largely unusual ability block shots along perimeter well basket

 might still happen even though league annual trade deadline passed even davis revealing wild interview session saturday open dealt boston celtics previously described one prepared suggest lakers trade chase
 firmest smartest declaration made juncture davis reverse layup swished left wing sunday night last two shots takes rest season
 time pelicans league officials davis camp collectively decide wisest move parties shelve brow new orleans remaining games
 davis every right like countless request trade sport best anointed james role model taking greater control futures ever juice
 happens though davis team able protect franchise interests anything else new orleans granted right
 emerged davis paul informed pelicans would signing million contract extension planning offer july wanted traded instead new orleans spent ensuing days trade deadline fielding offers davis mostly overzealous lakers knowing along pool worthy offers would wider waited june
 deadline predictably passed deal new orleans ordered play davis rest season even though precedent already set give team full control similar cases involving houston carmelo anthony memphis chandler parsons davis played four games since routinely taking proverbial air pelicans court recent appearance injuring shoulder
 pelicans want davis lineup gloom ongoing presence spawns also try avoid serious injury could adversely affect trade value position differentiate true like davis mortal players position absolutely
 two league main justifications case hold pelicans would willfully hurting public holding davis potential benefit new orleans could realize terms improving draft lottery odds may violates league rules governing competitive ring increasingly hollow
 toxic atmosphere new orleans home games customers spotted last week wearing paper bags heads scene straight depressing new orleans aints days yesteryear suddenly playing davis also affront pelicans fans know face franchise longer wants
 rival teams meanwhile whine want pelicans supposedly trying improve draft pick june sitting davis truth team new orleans position resigned trading davis getting much possible return would want put bubble wrap quickly possible
 davis made clear sunday night quiet cameo still wants play season much commissioner adam silver wants silver conceded interview sunday espn radio awkward dance resulting davis trade demand indeed become distraction
 unhealthy situation team frankly anthony well silver said
 call polite description tnt analysts charles barkley shaquille neal navigated complicated trade sagas players openly critical davis paul throughout duty
 think probably done summer done little bit quietly neal said interview anthony davis bad position player never want fans think care
 even davis hired paul expected scenario closer shaq outlined thought davis would play season fullest inform pelicans would pass extension thus force trade without ever explicitly requesting trade approach seemingly would meshed better davis reserved personality path chose instead made previously beloved davis unlikely villain
 shall pass time paul george jimmy butler kawhi leonard fellow elite talents found labeled similarly past months davis ultimately traded july eventually someone else becomes villain
 july ways although way gain real distance davis distraction trade materializes pelicans officials believe tangibly diminished sending away rest season especially two new orleans first four games break coming lebron lakers
 strong signals charlotte pelicans danny ferry serving acting general manager wake friday firing dell demps intend week hopes convincing league officials rethink stance forcing play davis
 players association would presumably get involved new orleans successful advise pelicans hold firm take fine comes team played better scrappier ball without davis anyway heaven forbid suffers serious injury regular season dog days

 minneapolis joshua langford michigan state guard remembered first time saw inch snow two years ago freshman year east lansing alabama native awoke one morning find campus absolutely covered stuff
 bro probably going cancel class told roommate former spartans star miles bridges
 recalling education winters upper midwest deadpanned week cancel class
 days langford remains one odd men rare michigan state player grow drive campus fact players roster year spartans seed faces texas tech national semifinal saturday night played high school basketball state michigan among players receiving scholarships seven
 langford since january knee injury spartans recent two games impressive wins louisiana state duke featured michiganders playing percent minutes
 could guys michigan coach izzo would like said dwayne stephens michigan state associate head coach
 stephens michigan two assistants recruiting coordinator iron mountain tom izzo
 michigan publicity type thing said star point guard cassius winston junior detroit want come place like michigan state got grind got work everything
 yet age national international recruiting prominent men basketball team public university dominated players state unusual one might think
 unlike football recruiting remained somewhat regional best basketball teams days draw players everywhere thanks summer leagues best players congregate april july showcases cities near large airports front coaches across country even prominent programs country classification definitely includes michigan state sign combined dozen players every year afford chase best
 talent comprising percent michigan state roster stands
 programs similar pedigree michigan state ratio tends much lower kansas kentucky two count brad calipari coach son went high school new jersey north carolina
 big ten occurrence ohio state equivalent figure wisconsin indiana
 fact assortment prominent basketball teams washington georgia ratios similar michigan state players red raiders roster michigan state face saturday texas
 trend new years michigan state biggest stars almost mitten staters winston michigan basketball university detroit jesuit high school bridges overall pick draft last year flint though played high school basketball several states denzel valentine lansing draymond green jason richardson saginaw
 dane fife another michigan state associate head coach former michigan basketball son longtime high school coach clarkston said kinship among players locker room also includes two ohioans one player indiana real competitive advantages sense loyalty school said
 biggest drawback focusing michigan basketball recruiting condition michigan basketball seen better days
 one thing simply fewer people michigan used state population census likely drop next year partly related travails auto industry last five years best recruit state michigan never ranked higher composite rankings
 several michigan state players coaches said another problem michigan high school athletic association rules limiting teams traveling national tournaments causing adverse impact michigan high school basketball indirectly michigan state recruiting
 instance detroit josh jackson top class recruit nationally played basketball elsewhere single season kansas
 people run high school basketball old rules definitely need updated said freshman foster loyer last year michigan basketball causing talent leave state
 mark uyl state association executive director said interview several states similar travel rules michigan case allow teams travel neighboring states plus illinois trips miles one direction
 high schools make membership believe found pretty good balance letting schools able travel find best competition midwest keeping academic balance uyl said
 michigan state staff attitude toward rules pretty clear hopefully stephens said things change
 another potential obstacle michigan state ability recruit state actually become advantage presence another public university one located proximately state population center gravity one considers far glamorous sibling
 possible heard university michigan particularly ever met anyone went
 though michigan two national championship games since michigan state last appeared one spartans nearly izzo michigan state head coach national title made eight final fours never going five seasons without playing tournament final weekend
 may wolverine state seven michigan players season four scholarship players michigan
 today teenagers born several years fab five left ann arbor michigan dominant program one maize blue

 colleges build sports facilities attract top recruits salaries coaches major football basketball programs ballooned recent years would call arms race worse yet cartel prevented players receiving fair compensation winners arms race coaches athletic directors unsurprisingly usually first people argue paying players

 best way understand mike trout outfielder baseball los angeles angels tuesday reportedly agreed richest contract north american sports perfect reflection sport
 little known many americans including sports fans trout best player game frequently mocked fading form entertainment primarily regional audiences
 baseball often dismissed far less enticing believed bring billion annually even health safety issues baseball also called less dynamic even though billion less revenue last year
 trout million contract revealed prompted obvious question could sport struggling attract new generation fans facing potentially bruising labor fight players two years afford yet another contract
 news trout deal came three weeks outfielder bryce harper accepted million contract phillies month infielder manny machado got million deal san diego padres
 comparison major league baseball players signed contracts least million
 answer mechanics collective bargaining agreement players owners anything might constitute referendum game popularity several dynamics work sport huge wealth still flows best best less money left middle class despite continuing growth baseball revenues
 owners seems figured keep costs using younger players cheaper veterans thus freeing cash occasional megadeal players like trout harper machado benefit others forced accept less
 past teams valuing players differently said james paxton starting pitcher yankees long time system fine teams changed way valuing players especially older players kind broken system forcing us take look
 study yet published bradbury economics professor kennesaw state university calculated baseball revenue rose average rate percent player salaries rose average rate percent
 major league baseball revenues reached billion last year sources include evermore money guaranteed sources like media deals entire sport lucrative media contracts many local level less important ticket sales generally fluctuate wins losses
 shift valuation players average salary went first time years little million according players association fourth time last years average gone
 dan halem deputy commissioner said evidence teams trying win painted different picture baseball economics
 salaries gone average percent year since keeping pace baseball revenue growth time said pay may slightly flat one year make trend also said last decade players received consistent percentage game revenue percent
 system depending upon year clubs valuing players said halem certain players better others
 yet words like collusion strike third rails sport especially ruinous strike regularly uttered players agents despite huge contracts
 focusing giant deals misses bigger picture according jeff borris longtime baseball agent represented stars like barry bonds general counsel ballengee group sports representation agency
 contracts like trout harper aberrations borris said focus things like dallas keuchel signed contract gio gonzalez signed areas concern
 keuchel starting pitcher houston astros remained unsigned one week opening day gonzalez solid durable starting pitcher signed deal yankees
 think owners manipulating system advantage borris said
 decades baseball players represented widely considered strongest union professional sports result baseball limits salaries though luxury tax penalizes team payroll rises million function de facto cap
 problem least articulated players teams reward superstars longer feel compelled spend win believe already pieces place compete championship
 interest players help teams win particularly get last two weeks spring training tony clark executive director players association said trout deal reached
 despite baseball strong union certain provisions kept salaries rising decades turned norms hard fast rules
 baseball players become free agents accrue six years service time generally paid league minimum first three seasons next three receive higher salaries negotiation arbitration leads odd situations like trout voted american league valuable player third full season earning million
 used acceptable players made back end careers infamous albatross contracts given veterans like million extension signed ryan howard time veteran players paid fair wage slightly overpaid well sometimes
 coincidence trout harper machado got megadeals age younger circumstances older players like gonzalez keuchel demonstrate teams working assumption veteran abilities likely decline soon salary peaks makes sense use younger players fill roster lower costs risks even chance make playoffs also reduced
 think thought teams sudden going stop competing degree said adam ottavino yankees pitcher lot things changed really fast

 rules implemented demonstrate another winter many veteran free agents lingered months sluggish open market league players willing modify current collective bargaining agreement even though expire season
 good see sides working together said infielder matt duffy union representative tampa bay rays good cooperation sides industry think creates healthy atmosphere industry game thrive
 players changes largely prelude complicated renegotiation financial aspects sides agreed discuss result immediate differences sport season including single trading deadline july
 read baseball debates rules players suggest trying harder win
 rule eliminates archaic somewhat confusing process trade waivers years created second summer trading period players still placed claimed outright waivers july according new rule traded date
 league also overhauled selection process game starters added million pool bonus money home run derby including million winner might enough motivate highly paid stars take part many young players million would dwarf annual salary
 got engaged married said pete alonso slugging mets prospect would earn minimum makes team would definitely pay wedding costs
 starters selected two phases primary round designated election first round fans vote starters position many years day late june early july fans vote choosing top three position initial round top nine outfielders

 judge understandably optimistic team odds competing world series title already fair wonder long core group players remain together cost
 yankees decision makers course already weighing questions biggest hint yankees already thinking ahead came month million extension could extend five years given severino approached key players like outfielder aaron hicks relief pitcher dellin betances possible extensions weigh much heavier yankees payroll current deals
 going paydays coming prepare said brian cashman yankees longtime general manager
 yankees seriously pursue star free agent manny machado many reasons asking price signed years million san diego padres desire spend money several areas roster instead fact already possess talented third baseman andujar huge contract giancarlo stanton million deal
 one factor financial future young standouts borrow cashman phrasing every dollar affects somebody else dollar
 everything connected said payrolls continue increase preparing preparing players think special continue journeys
 might seem unusual yankees valued forbes billion tradition chasing best free agents regardless price former owner george steinbrenner concerned future salaries players since steinbrenner heyday baseball implemented rules limit spending amateur draft international market luxury tax teams generally treat hard cap
 say yankees afford pursue free agents retain young stars jim duquette former mets general manager said highest luxury tax penalties could legitimate deterrent even teams wealthy yankees red sox paid million penalties million payroll penalized draft helped win last year world series
 able handle luxury tax penalties large markets grow players duquette said competitive picking low end draft hard hit aaron judges world first round drafted
 core like yankees strategy makes sense absolutely could afford pay tax penalties makes somewhat prohibitive
 last year first time since luxury tax put place yankees avoided penalties dropped million threshold first second payroll rankings decades yankees million payroll ranked sixth baseball according cot baseball contracts
 yankees estimated payroll luxury tax purposes season million first tax threshold million according relief horizon hefty contracts like jacoby ellsbury coming books two years sabathia retiring season
 big payouts also loom judge sanchez among others see big jumps pay become eligible salary arbitration hence yankees stated desire consider multiyear deals players pending players
 free agency tough duquette said hit miss like player know fit organization play well new york try keep together
 labor market seems increasingly tilted toward clubs players longer see free agency hallowed grounds dreamed since drug testing began teams increasingly wary players production age one effect increasing number players signing deals considered reaching free agency
 yankees broached extension talks betances hicks set become free agents season declined elaborate level discussions said would interested remaining yankees
 amazing place great future course something like part hicks said
 intriguing cases hicks blossomed new york acquired trade putting together best seasons career past two years home runs runs batted despite playing games last season dealt several injuries free agent

 nowadays middle relievers getting lot love betances said alone setup men jeurys familia joe kelly well betances teammates adam ottavino zack britton scored contracts least million
 another pending free agent yankees like shortstop didi gregorius also improved since trade new york go along stout defense gregorius hit averaged home runs past three years next season recovery tommy john surgery likely cut season half
 judge sanchez make least league minimum season yankees may wait next winter begin contract talks two severino
 focused season heard anything judge said last week asked yankees approached contract future
 coming rough season sanchez would seem unlikely entertain offers judge feel impulse cash earning power relatively soon given free agent season wait see market changes current collective bargaining agreement increasingly drawn ire players expires december

 aroldis chapman nicknamed cuban missile reason yankees lanky closer caribbean island long prominent face velocity explosion modern baseball ever since broke major leagues pitchers could match fastball
 last season month injured list left knee tendinitis sapped power average fastball speed dipped slightly previous season still among hardest throwers baseball first time since chapman tops louis cardinals relief pitcher jordan hicks nine years younger claimed title average according fangraphs
 problem chapman said spanish recently adding later anymore years pile choice
 eyebrows including injured inconsistent yankees understandably raised chapman began season albeit early april chill northeast throwing fastballs slow yet another potentially worrying issue yankees bullpen lived lofty expectations depleted roster general
 chapman concerned reason keeping past buildups speed ticked outing reaching ease two recent appearances admittedly small sample size seven games average back entering friday night win kansas city royals
 get work feel much better arm better well velocity pitches said chapman little little lot people worry velocity worried
 average picks temperature innings ultimately settle
 chapman still outlier given long held velocity yet continues aging even chapman thinks average entire season anymore want especially resurgence wipeout slider
 first years yes trying throw hard said years mentality starts changing objective throw hard pitch example tossing innings pitches possible throwing strikes every batter
 times last season chapman velocity hovered around larry rothschild yankees longtime pitching coach thought might new norm
 see big numbers rothschild said warms gets still see thrown lot fastballs high velocity point going see little bit dip
 feels preposterous doubt whether enough many professional pitchers unable throw hard let alone average entire season many years average fastball baseball last season according fangraphs chapman freakishly athletic set new norm
 years gone back cuban missile good said many pitchers throwing hard maybe two three pitchers throwing
 reach even starting pitchers chapman marveled hicks arm uncorked fastball game last may matching chapman fastest pitch recorded baseball history hard throwers reached big leagues yet chapman said
 even though chapman mitigated aging process bulking frame arm continue lose power time fastball already induced fewer swings misses year lowest rates since start career
 still chapman pointed even fastballs would enough succeed majors long still gets outs seven outings season mostly allowing two runs taking one loss striking nine walking one
 sizable lead friday yankees need chapman starter sabathia allowed one unearned run five innings bullpen rest outfielders brett gardner mike tauchman homered helping yankees overcome three errors field
 chapman one thing helped evolve slider departing via free agency last season reliever david robertson helped chapman tweak grip slider led sharper movement proved successful second half
 chapman used slider percent time last season partly yankees urging opponents hit whiffed percent time swung highest rate slider among relief pitchers baseball last season according baseball prospectus
 far season third chapman million deal yankees using slider even percent time said never felt better
 slider pitch still electric stuff think long wants healthy gives pitch going give longevity yankees manager aaron boone said last month adding later really impressed last year started use times able strike pitch better fastball
 say chapman trademark pitch feeble yet seeing fastballs chapman ninth inning april game baltimore orioles outfielder trey mancini struck offering middle plate
 seemed even harder mancini said thought probably eye test still electric pitch really tall guy releases ball seems like right top
 two days mancini saw three sliders chapman lining final one
 lot people know slider pretty darn good pitch mancini said age anything like slider still going make fastball look really hard even slightly less hard used

 brooklyn dodgers met old friend trip louis early season preacher roe sly slender lefty retired west plains entertained former teammates chase hotel needed advice
 sat around big table talking preacher recalls carl erskine top dodgers starter said fellas want ask question sports illustrated offered tell threw spitter think blacktop driveway fix house could really use think
 guys said yeah go ahead preach sure admired preacher great study watch pitch clever lot games really pitcher pitcher say yes leaving dining room preacher said hear speak said preacher outstanding pitcher without spitter hate see taint whole career talking throwing
 anyway preacher article got sometime later talked preach said carl know ruined chances hall fame admitting threw spitter one advised said well preacher saw pitch pitcher pitcher could without spitter
 maybe maybe erskine believed roe man confession roe said turned pitch slumping pirates reviving spitter practiced harry brecheen cardinals farmhand last chance made becoming regular though quite cooperstown candidate dodgers cheating made sense
 roe told dick young sports illustrated article decided get pitch get caught told kick anyway lose
 lose often roe much winning percentage seven seasons brooklyn guessed spitter earned bench innings roe would pop stick gum mouth announce going get new batch game spit meaty part thumb pretending wipe brow hitching belt subtly wipe index middle fingers saliva two wet fingers top dry thumb underneath roe ready compared squeezing peach pit watermelon seed fingertips
 idea get part grip wet dry said ball leaves hand slips wet fingers clings dry part thumb ball jumps account good un drops like dead duck crosses plate
 roe confession confirmed reputation stan musial wrote decades later always hitting roe two strikes usually load hated get anticipation spitter helped roe knew destroy evidence never caught act
 umpire would call ball preacher would stomp around look hand like probably got time erskine says instead tossing ball roll umpire ground
 like steroid users decades later roe stayed ahead cops thrived pang regret erskine least going public bursting cloud mystery showed knew done specter dark arts would indeed follow roe grave died word spitball appeared headline new york times obituary
 two chaotic decades spitball banned year country went dry prohibition rule simply turned mound speakeasy many pitchers going undercover get slippery edge predecessors
 physics behind spitball simple enough ball slides wet fingers loses backspin therefore rotates less something like knuckleball rotate forkball tumbling final plunge
 defacing surface ball produces kind effect added movement opposite side scuff also dates game early days imagine baseballs looked like early century
 play whole game one ball stayed park wahoo sam crawford hall famer played says glory times book lawrence ritter
 lopsided black full tobacco licorice stains crawford continues pitchers used way back
 even possibility scuffing gives pitchers edge words come chet brewer star kansas city monarchs negro national league late sound timeless
 cut ball got credit told john holway book black picked rough one throw game exactly put cuts could pitch
 scuffing charges never dogged mike mussina hall fame orioles yankees like smart pitcher would never reject ball came mark mussina order every catcher ball scrapes ground never volunteer umpire
 say guy hits ground ball short throw back first base soon grab ball running thumb mussina says holding ball referring white area within horseshoe sinker ball find one think pretty good flip side see scuffed wrong side
 means opposite side horseshoe areas scuffed counteract advantage scuff seams narrow sweet spot creates sinker pitch spins like straight fastball veers away direction opposite scuff
 common lament among retired pitchers many balls thrown play underscores lack craftsmanship mound
 literally seen teammates scuff ball get rid says jamie moyer games career ended year turned say oh funny stuff go wait minute funny stuff benefit
 hitters conditioned ask umpires discard ball skips umpires catchers know catchers tend almost reflexive response spear ball dirt transfer quickly throwing hand hold ump keep reject
 course fielders still try create scuff catchers may deliberately throws innings outfielders may routine throws infield times changed
 played ball hit dirt still play says chili davis mets hitting coach played today game catcher throws ball second short hop ball gets blocked dirt ball game automatic
 pitchers also seek ways look natural applying moisture tackiness fingers one former player broadcaster reached team ball bag pulled canister colorless spray helps secure athletic tape one spritz arm invisible island instant tackiness fingers
 also pitchers like putting clear bullfrog sunscreen arms grab rosin bag aimlessly touch bullfrog spot enough stickiness help guide pitches one catcher says seen pitchers leave dugout innings wrap fingers around ball coated pine tar leaving enough residue hands get better grip return mound
 next time go game notice surfaces pitcher touches hand pitchers fidgety creatures constantly tugging swiping scratching caps sleeves skin something corey kluber cy young award winner cleveland grabs tongue mound every pitch became legal years ago wipes hand side pants
 way rub balls rub advance kluber says rubbed day sit bucket dust stuff get slippery get little bit moisture hand least still got wipe obviously get little bit moisture hand ball dry
 kluber matter weather tactics especially handy cold high altitude harder generate moisture
 tell says one veteran could get camera behind dugout colorado would like mad scientist laboratory people anything find grip
 players even hitters tend accept practice pitch instrument destruction hitter would rather pitcher know going accidentally fire cue ball head fine distinction sure logic tackiness helps command finish pitch sandpaper jelly helps enhance movement
 cold weather minnesota something grip curveball says jim kaat starred twins pitchers years lobbied hitters use pine tar grip bat better help em hit farther able use pine tar
 comes back discretion yankees michael pineda brazenly smeared pine tar neck chilly night fenway park overt red sox felt compelled object pineda got suspension widespread ridicule generally long pitcher discreet side problem pine tar
 pine tar one thing cheating letter law yes spirit whatever happened spitball hall fame pitch jack chesbro ed walsh stan coveleski red faber burleigh grimes gaylord perry richie ashburn hits always thought pitchers shifty characters never trusted
 scoundrels gone

 ronald acuna years days old played games major league level hit season reached career home runs yet tuesday atlanta braves agreed contract locks eight years record price player age million
 braves ridiculous may sound almost assuredly got bargain
 contract acuna carry season includes team options could keep atlanta continued trend spring players seemingly wary slowing free agent market signing extensions teams earlier usual players lock large payday relatively young age postpone entry free agency process decades considered best way maximize career earnings
 mike trout prominent player sign huge extension agreeing million extension angels two years set become free agent nolan arenado supposed jewel next year class signed million extension colorado instead chris sale got million boston jacob degrom got million mets paul goldschmidt got million louis alex bregman got million houston
 deals
 extension spree may seem like baseball lavishing players cash clubs wary enormous deals like ones signed bryce harper manny machado season way save money long run lock players early reach free agency age maximize payday players unwilling endure years lower pay process harper machado went agreeing take less overall money exchange dose security
 seems especially relevant case acuna outfielder already done much young age two players easily compared harper machado
 last year rookie year campaign acuna accounted wins replacement despite playing games going way back john mcgraw position players age younger recorded season war figure least according baseball reference group includes hall famers three players trout harper machado hall fame track alex rodriguez player complicated hall fame case becomes eligible certainly put hall fame numbers
 members group claudell washington outfielder several teams dick hoblitzell first baseman cincinnati boston early century failed live early promise jason heyward despite sensational age fell latter half
 even accounting limitations washington hoblitzell mixed results heyward remains relatively solid decision gamble players stars age especially considering potential savings braves
 acuna eschewed extension traditional path likely would spent season next one earning near major league minimum would entered baseball arbitration process likely could commanded million first year million second year million third year would free agent presumably setting deal worth million per year
 realistically acuna might cost million lifetime deal another million considering two million team options team exercise end eight years also unlikely hit open market turning age players become much less likely receive lengthy contracts
 plenty reasons celebrate deal acuna braves player organization since gets paid instead waiting payday road atlanta secured face franchise much player prime braves upshot includes healthy bit savings long run

 readers discuss argued would harmful college sports
 editor
 pay college athletes cody mcdavis
 wait minute purpose college provide education division sports particularly football basketball corrupted college athletics totally lost sight purpose college higher education would much better colleges universities followed division iii rules academic scholarships
 mcdavis suggests let national basketball association developmental league pay aspiring young basketball talent also let minor league baseball continue pay aspiring young baseball players organize developmental football leagues pay aspiring pro football players
 issue whether students paid whether professional sports belong universities
 tom barnardshaker heights ohio

 cody mcdavis opinion paying athletes play college sports wrong would ruin college sports already road ruin time
 unfortunately top divisions college football basketball become predictable point boredom sure occasional interloper virginia commonwealth university george mason butler generally teams mix sports think alabama clemson football duke kentucky north carolina michigan basketball
 face facts pay students done romantic notion school spirit amateur competition money nothing
 rule rule would keep students school four years would keeping spirit national collegiate athletic association however given level money corruption real change going happen paying athletes would least small step toward honesty
 gerald bowmanmunich
 editor
 cody mcdavis says paying college athletes would create arms race select group college programs could compete reality arms race exactly college sports currently function particularly true major college football basketball programs
 colleges build sports facilities attract top recruits salaries coaches major football basketball programs ballooned recent years would call arms race worse yet cartel prevented players receiving fair compensation winners arms race coaches athletic directors unsurprisingly usually first people argue paying players
 arms race governs major college sports select group top programs healthy ecosystem exists opportunities nonscholarship intercollegiate competition personally grateful opportunity existed confident similar opportunity would exist even successful college players paid fairly
 compensating top structure value bring ruin college sports ensure college sports remain something enjoyed many fans students alumni

 por manny fernández en donna texas
 la primavera llegó la frontera eso significa que comienzan esos meses en los que decenas de miles de jubilados de minnesota dakota del sur illinois otras partes del medio oeste de estados unidos adoptan al sur de texas como su segundo hogar
 los jubilados en traje de baño andan en bicicletas para llegar las piscinas suelen llevar flotadores de tubo bajo el brazo como lanzas de combate caballo desfilan por la calle con sus carritos de golf se aventuran ir méxico para comprar medicamentos más baratos hacerse pedicuras tratamientos dentales de bajo costo beber margaritas en copas enormes
 se les conoce como winter texans texanos invernales se concentran principalmente en el valle del río grande la región templada al sur de texas que también es la zona por donde pasan la mayor cantidad de migrantes desde centroamérica el presidente donald trump ha declarado una emergencia nacional en la frontera ha apostado soldados del ejército para ayudar controlar la creciente afluencia uno de sus campamentos base estaba menos de un kilómetro del centro vacacional victoria palms en donna adonde llegan muchas personas mayores para ocupar cinco canchas de pickleball un juego que es una mezcla de bádminton tenis ping pong
 la invasión anual de los residentes del medio oeste unos cuantos ha disminuido en años recientes pero siguen representando una importante fuerza económica cultural unos visitantes invernales gastaron alrededor de millones de dólares en el valle durante la temporada de invierno de según una encuesta realizada por la universidad de texas valle del río grande los restaurantes montan pancartas para recibirlos hay periódicos para texanos invernales parques para remolques con restricciones de edad mínima exposiciones cruceros producciones teatrales calcomanías de parachoques una camioneta en la ciudad fronteriza de mcallen tenía dos texano invernal de iowa estoy jubilado rebásame
 permite escapar de los bancos de nieve dijo dean miller de años residente de detroit lakes minnesota quien durante el invierno vive trabaja en el centro vacacional winter ranch en álamo texas vas un evento aquí te encuentras tu vecino de allá
 la mayoría de los texanos invernales son de raza blanca tienen años más muchos de ellos votaron por trump en su mera presencia contradice la afirmación que hizo el presidente acerca de que la frontera está en crisis vienen la región desde hace años algunos casos siguiendo la tradición de sus la dinámica política la retórica de la emergencia nacional afecta cómo viven su jubilación ni dónde lo hacen
 nosotros vemos lo que ustedes ven en la televisión dijo terry goss director general de victoria palms una de las comunidades más grandes de texanos invernales con hasta jubilados
 es exactamente lo que les atrae los texanos invernales
 conocer la vida fronteriza que se parece en nada lo que la mayoría de los estadounidenses imagina que es un viernes se celebró el cuarto evento benéfico de baile sock hop en el centro ranchero village en weslaco hubo almuerzos de pescado recorridos en bote por el río baile de cuadrillas sesiones de karaoke conciertos improvisados de bluegrass acústico servicios religiosos ecuménicos
 un lunes por la tarde en el centro vacacional winter ranch en álamo la compañía teatral de winter ranch agotó las entradas en su presentación de tres obras de un solo acto ethel albert comedies en victoria palms goss habló de pie junto un cartel que mostraba todos los espectáculos agotados en el salón de baile del centro uno de ellos era el concierto de una banda tributo rolling stones victoria palms es tan popular con los canadienses que casi todos los veranos se programa una reunión de los huéspedes de victoria palms cerca de toronto
 margaret hitzemann de años habitante de onamia minnesota pasó los últimos dos meses en una casa en port aransas cerca de corpus christi una tarde lluviosa ella su esposo cruzaron la frontera pie hacia la ciudad turística de nuevo progreso tamaulipas compraron chapulines crujientes fueron una farmacia para comprar medicamentos baratos
 tomamos muchas medicinas así que pensamos ah vayamos allá compremos un poco de tylenol advil cosas así por menos dinero dijo hitzemann pensé cielos esto vale lo mismo en walmart así que al final compramos ningún medicamento
 en una región con una gran población latina una actitud tolerante hacia la inmigración personas tienen familiares en ambos lados de la el choque cultural con los habitantes del norte es inevitable el estudio publicado por la universidad de texas valle del río grande incluyó mensajes sin editar enviados funcionarios locales de parte de texanos invernales algunos de los comentarios más mordaces decían sean más estadounidenses menos mexicanos estamos en méxico hagan que el canal respete trump poden el césped recojan la basura hablen inglés
 ya ha comenzado el éxodo de regreso al norte el final de la temporada llegó para muchos el jueves de marzo con el día del turista una fecha anual de aprecio los texanos invernales en nuevo progreso
 para algunos la temporada nunca termina existen los texanos conversos antiguos texanos invernales que se asentaron en el valle de por vida kristi collier es originaria de mcallen dirige una empresa hotelera mediática que presta servicios texanos invernales llamada welcome home rio grande valley ella organiza una fiesta anual de toma de juramento los texanos conversos en abril
 entre los conversos se encuentran ken lois lane originarios de anchorage alaska quienes empezaron pasar sus inviernos en victoria palms en ahora viven ahí permanentemente en una casa móvil
 creo que el costo de vida aquí es muy razonable en comparación con muchos otros lugares opinó ken de años técnico electricista retirado que trabajaba para una compañía eléctrica
 él su esposa visitaron nuevo progreso recibieron su hijo su familia cuando vinieron pasar las vacaciones de primavera desde iowa la pareja encaja en una categoría única son una suerte de texanos invernales la inversa
 conservamos la casa rodante en el verano cuando hace mucho calor vamos al norte explicó ken

 mcmahon productor lechero en el norte del estado de nueva york
 las granjas en el norte de nueva york están miles de kilómetros de la frontera sur pero están muy cerca de canadá por lo que la patrulla fronteriza tiene jurisdicción en esa zona la dependencia que tienen los agricultores de los trabajadores indocumentados ha convertido la región en un punto focal del debate sobre las políticas fronterizas del gobierno de trump lo cual ha exacerbado las tensiones entre los políticos estatales de ambos partidos los agentes federales que ejecutan las medidas severas del mandatario en contra de la inmigración ilegal
 esta semana christina goldbaum reportera sobre inmigración en la sección metro de new york times exploró en un artículo la historia de mcmahon la de los migrantes que trabajan en granjas como la de él lee más al respecto aquí

 la primavera pasada radiolab de wnyc transmitió border project una serie en tres entregas acerca de una política de la patrulla fronteriza que muy probablemente provocó un aumento desde finales de los años noventa en la cantidad de migrantes que morían al cruzar estados unidos también comparte las historias de algunos de los migrantes que emprendieron el trayecto pesar de ello escucha todos los episodios aquí

 se buscan traductores de lenguas indígenas centroamericanas los tribunales estadounidenses encargados de resolver asuntos migratorios tienen un retraso de casos el aumento en la llegada de migrantes procedentes de centroamérica ha empujado la situación al límite según las declaraciones de abogados activistas e intérpretes en este reportaje
 estados unidos provee traductores en lenguas de todo el mundo sin embargo se da abasto en quiché ixil zapoteco lenguas indígenas que están entre los veinticinco idiomas más recurrentes en las cortes migratorias hay poblaciones enteras que se presentan con idiomas que hemos visto antes en estados unidos dijo odilia romero una intérprete de zapoteco activista

 sometimes etches name significant milestones highest scorer spanish history goals calendar year sometimes feats seem like statistical quirks curious pieces trivia player scored two goals la liga games messi example records though serve testament greatness one offers proof consistency brilliance
 yet records breaks remarkable career becomes less impact new mark messi scaling heights previously thought unimaginable surpassing marks deemed indelible frequent mundane messi rewriting history books natural order things excellence normalized
 done effect sort impish argentine equivalent politics known shifting overton window public discourse refers gradual process taking concepts previously considered unthinkable making first seem feasible finally ordinary
 messi effect works lines cristiano ronaldo made habit scoring unfathomable numbers goals assumed tallies impossible done made seem attainable attainable seems less special looks
 worst consequence phenomenon messi splendor occasionally little underappreciated something loss watching others suffering genius fatigue consequences severe
 week tottenham faces burnley chelsea arsenal premier league must likely win three games keep within touching distance manchester city liverpool england title race
 fine margins even single slip may prove fatal condemn spurs manager mauricio pochettino team accusations lack cutting edge carat mass shine among elite pochettino like messi suffer standards set
 worth considering though nature tottenham pochettino took tottenham team deep shadow two fiercest rivals arsenal chelsea one occasionally featured champions league one even among ardent fans considered genuine contenders premier league title
 course pochettino almost five seasons club transformed tottenham certainly better team either arsenal chelsea become fixture champions league place season quarterfinals well within grasp
 since pochettino took charge one team manchester city points premier league twice tottenham mounted sustained challenges first english championship since season managed cling coattails city liverpool points stage season handful teams history
 given circumstances season pochettino overseen thus far may rank finest yet transfer window closed tottenham became first team premier league history add single player course entire campaign
 parsimony extreme character since pochettino arrived may tottenham spent barely half amount lavished manchester city manchester united squads sale midfielder mousa dembélé january meant since pochettino arrived club invested less million net transfer market

 club continues unhappily play home games wembley series delays completion new stadium likely available april earliest though even pochettino seems suspect even target ambitious suggested earlier month would tough play start next season
 tottenham still breath necks manchester city liverpool yet remarkable feat yet messi always feel though celebrated
 pochettino like messi changed parameters conversation made extraordinary ordinary previously unthinkable spurs might title contenders accepted almost expected indeed question often posed pochettino whether team falling short yet trophy show progress
 validity question sky sports commentator jamie carragher pointed earlier season tottenham team comes remembered fans take account played home games much spent reinforce simply ask hard avoid feeling relevance overplayed

 schmelzer borussia dortmund left back performed ritual times last decade building unparalleled expertise field pored countless clips hoping find something anything would give little advance warning bit head start
 tried find pattern said thus far though drawn blank even years even hours study even games defender knows arjen robben better anyone else still work exactly going cut inside
 outside seem predictable players world soccer robben performed calling card often since first joined bayern munich years ago bears name germany also france act cutting right wing shoot left foot known le robben player acknowledged last month proud move
 remarkable though maneuver lost none power surprise appears retain capacity surprise
 robben deep final season munich may make final appearance champions league club week bayern prove unable get past liverpool delicately poised last tie wednesday munich allianz arena
 time germany impressively successful six straight bundesliga titles slew domestic cups scored winning goal champions league final also admirably long robben years since josé mourinho first signed chelsea since joined real madrid
 remains though integral part one soccer great powers winger genuine menace silken touch searing speed lionel messi cristiano ronaldo era leading men robben among prominent members supporting cast instantly recognizable fixture game exalted stage signature move regular feature latter rounds champions league
 familiar barely needs description robben sprints right wing one arm outstretched balance head pulled back legs whirring approaches penalty area feints right drops shoulder shift weight slip left ball never leaves control opponent left grasping shadows
 robben glances curls shot across goalkeeper always go course frequently enough schmelzer one spent considerable time trying work stop
 though comes puzzle robben cutting left years intent apparent defenders know exactly mind precisely coming yet remain powerless stop
 robben two factors explain continued success timing said interview handful british newspapers last month one key right time still surprises variation previously suggested equally important thing without variation work said never pass dribble go outside cutting inside stop working
 schmelzer deal robben direct competition opponent something else however noticed robben leaned heavily favored move recent years using wing decoy open path still works though recognizes block path reacts accordingly makes special
 ability improvise ricardo rodriguez identified rodriguez swiss defender milan knows robben almost well schmelzer according gracenote sports faced times career time wolfsburg zurich
 fast especially ball rodriguez said makes difficult stop terribly fast cuts inside way try stop stay close hurt time
 reason cognitive scientist named shanti ganesh based radboud university netherlands conducted study robben movement determined robben moves little faster conscious defender brain ganesh said unconsciously follows robben feints even knows deep feints time takes rectify error robben always going everyone involved knew going cut inside taken shot player still correct ganesh said always fraction late
 theory chimes empirical study conducted wendell brazilian left back bayer leverkusen faced robben times since moving germany behind schmelzer rodriguez
 normally move also move tired seeing running getting ball said must something maybe waits last moment know time try wait move bigger chance getting ball back take time chance dribble past
 like schmelzer wendell spent time might like watching clips robben like schmelzer remembers training sessions days leading games bayern team worked defend danger dealt collectively
 dortmund always approach need teammates back schmelzer said honest simply possible take match full minutes jürgen klopp always taught us problem losing duel covering
 schmelzer decided go tackle relied central defender mats hummels defensive midfielder sven bender scurry across support always enough robben acting alone could always call threat philipp lahm later joshua kimmich streaking right wing collect ball overlap schmelzer conscious
 working use cut inside merely decoy always challenge even years opponents tell move coming seen yet somehow every time feels like first time study tapes stay close call backup
 none works wendell said one last resort try get ball back said commit fails often skips away quickly disappears flash arjen robben years always cuts inside

 liverpool england mohamed salah edge opposition box liverpool side defender snapping heels little burst speed creates touch glimmer space ball left foot touches inches front
 mohamed salah scored goal seemed score goal almost continually last season opening body wrapping foot round ball generating enough whip carry high across goalkeeper arcing far corner goal last year puskas award goal one point seemed become signature
 mechanics still sets ball used shapes body used safe assume aiming corner used time though quite enough ball curls fades soon picks height little jordan pickford everton goalkeeper barely moves ball drifts welcome arms
 salah missed glaring opportunities liverpool last week visited team desperate see fail left goalless draw cost little higher time around single point manchester united last week took liverpool top premier league table result everton sunday left point behind manchester city
 salah player might diverted course game joel matip fabinho particular spurned chances become folk heroes often twice half raced clear feet blur bore goal twice touch heavy twice timing awry pickford saved one defender michael keane stopped
 though best chances first one curled straight pickford hands symbolic salah campaign far everything almost exactly used unstoppable season last year quite
 course unavoidable salah would accused suffering popularly known syndrome unfortunate thing setting quite high bar last season even slightest even slightest perception interpreted anticlimax
 anything repeat improbable feats first season liverpool goals premier league games competitions would certainly enough invite criticism run form illusion
 proved salah scored goals premier league games season good course respectable obviously goal every two games still smart inclusion fantasy team clearly total bettered sergio agüero putting salah ahead harry kane aubameyang rest billions dollars strikers premier league still quite really
 salah indeed strange kind busted flush according manager jürgen klopp unplayable recently four days ago twisted curdled blood adam masina watford left back win anfield criticized disappearing games always wrongly one truly game liverpool season far champions league napoli salah scored goal still club leading scorer even goodison park even stalemate abundantly clear liverpool greatest threat

 perhaps early months season mitigating circumstances lingering effects shoulder injury sustained champions league final one threatened involvement world cup hampered performances russia
 perhaps even injury healed effects still felt klopp dismisses notions salah lost confidence heavy touches deft slight stumbles sure surefire signs
 salah newfound profile means deal closer attentions opposing defenders times absence much creative assistance liverpool midfield much year new position able pick burden quite fluid quite free used

 move seems prescient two new administrators supervising athletics sought allay concerns coaches could put undue pressure admissions personnel change also brought oversight athletics case committee senior faculty members deans university representatives
 previous arrangement said philip ballinger associate vice provost overseeing admissions sufficient transparency enough eyes
 leeway coaches get recruiting long point discussion higher education circles federal investigators last week revealed broad admissions cheating scandal number colleges began asking hard questions evaluate athletic applicants oversee chosen coaches recommend admission
 prosecutors described biggest case admissions fraud investigated people accused scheme involved paying bribes coaches people monitor admissions tests order fraudulently get children wealthy patrons nation elite colleges

 fraud case sent thunderbolt higher education community
 every college president america called athletic director morning admissions fraud story broke asked make sure happen school said bill martin athletic director university michigan retirement certain athletic directors smart enough call presidents first insist going start verifying status every admitted recruited athlete
 indeed yale university investigators say longtime women soccer coach accepted hundreds thousands dollars facilitate admission recruit actually play soccer university president peter salovey announced late last week new oversight policies already put place yale athletic director begin reviewing every proposed recruit credentials admission recruited athletes fail make team arrive receive close scrutiny university statement said
 broad overhaul athletic admissions systems division highest level competition level colleges scheme compete overdue according several athletic administrators interviewed recent days
 battles recruits football basketball already tend heavily scrutinized upper echelon sports money changing hands coaches recruits way around
 sports like crew volleyball tennis soccer often called olympic sports room bribes exploitation common route fraud designate phony athletic prospect recruited nearly every case counterfeit athletic credentials cited last week indictments stanford texas yale prospective athlete appeared filling nebulous role recruited
 applicants even assured spot team often list five athletes varies sport sport coach permitted submit admissions department
 two daughters actress lori loughlin charged connection fraud case last week passed crew recruits despite never competed sport according federal prosecutors
 choice sport may accident sport like women crew rosters balloon athletes many teams scores recruited large rosters help college comply federal equality laws balancing number male athletes football
 rosters big like women crew could see would possible coach slip unqualified person recruited said martin added michigan annually audited team rosters
 recruitment athletes sports may even bigger factor admissions process colleges lowest tier division iii athletic scholarships forbidden

 small colleges like largest ones also give preferential treatment applicants excel music arts host skills also allowances students states
 admissions filling different buckets said wendy smith athletic director haverford college highly rated institution near philadelphia athletes right way gaming system absolutely par academically
 cost fielding successful sports team ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads troubling conflicts interest
 ivy league example coaches responsible bridges gap support college true price tag competing successfully lead uncomfortable decisions composing team especially since athletes families often become leading donors
 family give going play daughter said paul wardlaw women tennis coach brown university years
 whole scandal interesting human nature take easy route said systematic issues contributing
 many elite institutions notion recruited athletes granted unfair advantage palpable
 cameron green tight end football team northwestern university accepts percent applicants conceded several high school classmates play sports applied northwestern rejected
 easier athletes get know hard regular students said green senior plan play football final year eligibility lot kids knew confused got know end day school looks demographics piece paper decides admit even meet
 high percentage recruited athletes colleges particularly smaller ones consequences odds institutional ambitions diverse student body
 success youth sports today often comes easily affluent families spend copiously private instruction rosters college teams become predominantly white nearly percent small schools
 end higher education community believe last week admissions fraud scandal embarrassing lesson policy changes need made nevertheless creating false impression state admissions procedures american colleges
